#### TIY Week 5 Day 4 &dash; Cohort 7

### **[The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com)** Cohort 7 &dash; Ruby On Rails Back-End Engineer

#### My first rails app that uses all the lessons so far with a proper design in mind.
#### There will be several versions of this app in my GitHub.
#### The reasoning for this is how we turn in the assignment and how I marked my progress.

- This application shows the use of the following technologies:
  - Ruby
  - Rails
  - Postgress
  - Active Records
  - Bootstrap
- The major features of the application are:
  - Dynamic Web pages
  - Record Association
  - Image Processing
  - Oauth User Authentication
